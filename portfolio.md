# Portfolio

* Jeewoong Chang. 2017. [Statistical Evaluation of CCG Cards: To what extent does ordinary least squares regression accurately assess the true mana cost of Hearthstone cards in a randomly drafted format?](/Media/Jeewoong-Chang-mathematics-EE.pdf) *IB Mathematics Extended Essay.*

A popular collectible card game Hearthstone was analyzed as part of IB Diploma curriculum's independent research requirement. [Ellie Burzstein's](https://elie.net/) method of card evaluation through ordinary linear squares regression was studied and understood. This principle of OLS regression was demonstrated in 2-dimensional and n-dimensional cases with calculus and linear algebra, respectively. Then, the method was applied to 2017's card pool and statistically analyzed against an empirical index. Consequently, possible sources of error and potential solutions were proposed. Through iterative improvements of the base model, R<sup>2</sup> value was increased from 0.047 to 0.091. Finally, this result was compared with private, proprietary models.
