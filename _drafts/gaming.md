Gaming has had a complicated role in my life ever since I installed Minecraft on my potato laptop during middle school. I've had numerous memorable gaming experiences that shaped me since. The wonderous story of Bioshock Infinite kept me hooked for hundreds of hours of gameplay on a 12-hour linear narrative; Hearthstone offered me the chance to compete in a collegiate league; Overwatch drew me in with its vibrant characters and got me hooked in the tanking role; Life is Strange had me crying every episode. Binding of Isaac, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, League of Legends, Hades, Oxenfree, Limbo, and more come to mind as well.

I love gaming. So a layperson may be surprised if I tell you that gaming often isn't fun anymore. It feels...dull. Dr. Alok Kanojia (Dr.K), a Harvard psychiatrist specializing in behavioral addiction, explained why. According to Dr.K, the reward circuits of our brain get accustomed to the level of stimulation that gaming provides. First, gamers game for fun. After years, he says, many gamers game out of a sense of obligation. It's not that gaming is fun. The problem is that everything else becomes even more boring.

I can relate to Dr.K's observations on a deep level. I've had lots of times when I would be gaming and get bored of it. I felt, "I just can't do this anymore!" I'd concede and uninstall the game, convinced that I can play it in the future. Many times, I even deleted my account to be sure. Of course, the withdrawal kicks in after mere hours. Almost like enchanted by a spell, I would crawl back to gaming. I'm sure many seasoned gamers can relate to this cycle.

I feel a strong reason why I kept on being defensive is due to my parents' ignorance about gaming. They're typical Asian parents who think gaming is the source of my problems, not its symptom. As such, I had to stand up for a medium which frankly has no fault of its own. I was seasoned enough to know that gaming can be a fun and enriching experience. We'd scream at each other and my mom would take my gaming PC's power cord at night so I can sleep, regretting ever having bought me the PC. My dad would tell me that 15 minutes of gaming per day should be enough, and I'd cry and yell at him that that's only enough time to queue up a game and choose my characters. They don't understand. They don't get it. Gaming isn't an issue. They are.

It didn't help that, having grown up as a smart kid under heavy-handed Asian parents, Hearthstone was the first thing that I ever got really good at out of my own accord. It was my pride. I couldn't let my parents take it away from me.
