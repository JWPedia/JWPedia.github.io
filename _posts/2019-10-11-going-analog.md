I recently revisited the book [Digital Minimalism](/quality-feb-2019). This time, however, I borrowed a physical copy through my university's interlibrary loan program.

The purpose of moving away from my [exclusively digital](/reading-habit) reading habit is to rediscover some of the lost values of analog: analog reading, analog writing, and analog existence.

As an experiment, I am going to fully commit to a month-long digital detox as suggested in Digital Minimalism.

That means the only digital technologies that I am allowed to use are the bare essentials:

*   I can use email and browse the web for schoolwork and other necessary purposes.
*   I can use a messaging application _on a computer_ to have video calls with my family back at home.
*   I can send text messages and make phone calls.
*   I can use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog replacement is not available.
*   I can use a computer for programming and related tasks, such as occasionally posting to this blog, experimenting with the bash shell, or using XCode to practice Swift development.

However, I am not allowed to:

*   Browse the internet for entertainment, especially Reddit and Youtube.
*   Use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog alternative exists.
*   Unnecessarily check my phone or email.
*   Play video games.
*   Consume digital media in a non-social setting.
*   Subscribe to any type of feed, such as email newsletters.

To stick to these rules, I made some lifestyle changes:

*   I got a paper journal (on which this very post is being written).
*   I removed every single non-default app from my phone.
*   I removed Windows installation from my desktop computer and installed Pop! OS, an Ubuntu variant, instead.
*   I learned the basics of the bash shell so that I can get things done on the command line.
*   I borrowed three paper books to read in my leisure time.
*   I started wearing an automatic watch instead of using my phone to check my time.
*   I started turning off my phone during the day.

In the time I have now due to purging digital entertainment, I will be:

*   Getting work done.
*   Reading books.
*   Relaxing more.
*   Meditating.
*   Socializing.
*   Going on walks.
*   Sleeping early.

I am curious how this detox will go. I will report back in a month.
