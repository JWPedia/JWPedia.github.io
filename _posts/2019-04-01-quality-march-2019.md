This post is the second installment of a monthly series in which I give short impressions/review about media that I consumed and enjoyed that month. If you're new to the series, you can read [February's Post](quality-feb-2019) or continue straight to my favorite book for this month, which is......

### [Book: She Has Her Mother's Laugh: Powers, Perversions, and Potential of Heredity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36391536-she-has-her-mother-s-laugh)

She Has Her Mother's Laugh is probably the most recent and the most comprehensive book about heredity and genetics for the general audience. It is over 500 pages long, yet no words are wasted. This book covers the history of genetics, its many failed hypothesis, up until the most recent and mind-blowing discoveries. If you think heredity is confined to Mendelian genetics, you'd be surprised. As the author Carl Zimmer captivatingly narrates, heredity is not as clear-cut as we once thought it was. It is a messy web of genetic information in between and even within individuals. While the language is descriptive enough for those that do not have much background knowledge to understand, the content is recent enough for even a seasoned science reader to learn something new and interesting. Even those who are already experts in genetics could find the science history section of the book fascinating. There's really not many negatives to say about this book.

### [Research: Trends of Fiction in 2000s Japanese Pop Culture](http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/ejcjs/vol14/iss2/tanaka)

### [Youtube Video: Understanding Apocalypse, Part 1: Death Note and the Cynical Apocalypse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvvUiXc6m7U)

### [Youtube Video: Shadows of Fukushima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYCFLwjG6S4)

For this whole month, I have been writing a research paper about Korean disaster films. After thinking too much about the apocalypse, it seems like my own head is about to explode. For those who have some background knowledge about either apocalyptic literature, Japanese pop culture, or sociology, the first research paper is a quick read about _sekaikei_, _sekaibukei_ and _nichijoukei_ subgenres. For those who are less exposed to this field of sociological media criticism, Pause and Select's Youtube video series "Understanding Apocalypse" and "Shadows of Fukushima" are two excellent resources to delve into the subject. Pause and Select is such a goldmine of a channel, that I featured it in my [previous post](quality-feb-2019) as well.

### [Article: The Complete Guide to Memory](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/02/15/memory/#summary)

Scott H Young is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to productivity blogs. While some of his projects are indeed impressive, his rapid learning philosophy can all so easily be misused. Still, this incredibly long yet concise primer on remembering things is very applicable to any knowledge worker.

This month's entry is somewhat short, as I have not had a great chance to check out new and exciting media. Perhaps next month will have better content, as I plan to play through several critically acclaimed games. It stands to see whether they'll stand up to my expectations.
