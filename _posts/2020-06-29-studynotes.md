Study Notes is an upcomong series of articles that will be a brief and comprehensive overview of selected STEM topics. As I have explained in my [about](/about) page, the url and tile of this blog "jwpedia" is a combination of my initial "jw" and the suffix "-pedia" as in encyclopedia. I figured it's about time I humor the title of this whole website. 

Teaching is the best way to deeply understand a topic. As an aspiring academic, I have good incentives to form a rock-solid understanding of these foundational topics. These posts will start with the intuitive understanding of each topic, full of visualizations and analogies, and increase in complexity and rigor as I run through the mathematically rigorous methods of analysis. This series is made for both me, and any wandering learner of the internet that might find it helpful. 

# Content Planning

The syllabus - if I can call it that - is more or less linear. The Foundations of Science course briefly outlines basic scientific and mathematical techniques. 

The General Physics course covers materials from high school physics to university-level physics. While each section or unit can be read independently, the whole course will make the most sense when read sequentially. It presumes understanding of calculus and later, some differential equations and linear algebra. However, the latter are not necessary to get an intuitive grasp of concepts. 

The General mathematics course covers pre-calculus, calculus, and foundational university courses: discrete mathematics, differential equations, linear algebra, probability and statistics, and complex analysis. 

Also planned are computer science courses: Data Science & Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Theory of Computation, and more. Electrical Engineering courses may also be introduced down the line.
