Study Notes is an upcomong series of articles that will be a brief and comprehensive overview of selected STEM topics. As I have explained in my [about](/about) page, the url and tile of this blog "jwpedia" is a combination of my initial "jw" and the suffix "-pedia" as in encyclopedia. I figured it's about time I humor the title of this whole website. 

Teaching is the best way to deeply understand a topic. As an aspiring academic, I have good incentives to form a rock-solid understanding of these foundational topics. These posts will start with the intuitive understanding of each topic, full of visualizations and analogies, and increase in complexity and rigor as I run through the mathematically rigorous methods of analysis. This series is made for both me, and any wandering learner of the internet that might find it helpful.
