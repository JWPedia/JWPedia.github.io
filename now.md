# What I'm Doing Now

Inspired by Derek Sivers' [Now](https://sivers.org/now) page, I've also decided to make one of my own. If you're wondering what I'm up to, this page is a handy reference. It is also a reminder for me to focus on the essentials in life.

# Sweet, Sweet, Suite Quarantine

Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the University of Rochester wants its students to go back home, except for a few dangerous countries. South Korea happens to be one. As such, until this situation subsides, I'm stuck at my campus suite taking online classes. The classes I'm currently studying for are:

* Introduction to Programming with Java
* Discrete Mathematics
* Intermediate Chinese II
* Writing for CS
* History of Energy

# Learning Programming

Since the introductory computer science course I'm currently taking is somewhat below my skill level, I'm studying ahead on my own. I'm following Princeton's Algorithms 4 textbook. With this knowledge, I'm also tackling some [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/skaliq/) and [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/profile/AmiraOfArmageddon.png) problems where I can.

I've also had to learn Jekyll to create this website and dabble in iOS development with Swift.

# Self Care

To maintain a semblance of a healthy daily routine while in quarantine, I'm trying to do these things every day:

* Sleeping regularly
* Eating three meals
* At-home bodyweight workout
* Meditation
* Reading the news
* Getting ready to "commute" (to home)
* Housework
* Reading
* Video calling my SO, friends, or family

# Entertainment

For pure entertainment purposes, I'm indulging myself with these things these days:

* Hearthstone Battlegrounds, my current favorite video game.
* Watching movies I should've watched a long time ago.
