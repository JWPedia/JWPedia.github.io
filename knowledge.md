This is a brief overview of what I've learned in higher education, and what I want to learn in the future. It's based largely on Matt Might's [What CS Majors Should Know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/). It's both a checklist to cross out, and a collection of my personal tried-and-true resources.
