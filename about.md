Hi, I am Jiwon, an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester studying B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics. Welcome to my personal blog! This website's URL, JWPedia, stands for **J**i**w**on's **p**ersonal encyclop**edia.**

I write about technology, sciences, techno criticism, and intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to better understand the way information technology shapes our modern lives.

You won't find me on social media. If you have anything to say, leave an email at [hello@jwpedia.com](mailto:hello@jwpedia.com).<br><br>Subscribe to future posts via [rss](https://jwpedia.com/feed.xml).

All blog posts are my original content, and they are all [open](/open). That means you can use them for any purpose. I won't chase after you if you use a post to earn a million dollars or make Reddit memes. I simply would ask for attribution as a matter of basic human decency. Note that this open policy only applies to this blog and not my other endeavours.</p>
