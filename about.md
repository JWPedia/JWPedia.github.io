Hi, I am Jiwon, an undergraduate student at the University of Rochester studying B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics. Welcome to my personal blog! This website's URL, JWPedia, stands for **J**i**w**on's **p**ersonal encyclop**edia.**

I write about technology, sciences, techno criticism, and intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to better understand the way information technology shapes our modern lives.

You won't find me on social media. You can leave an email at [hello@jwpedia.com](mailto:hello@jwpedia.com) or subscribe to future posts via [rss](https://jwpedia.com/feed.xml).

All blog posts are my original content, and they are all [open](/open). That means you can use them for any purpose. I won't chase after you if you use a post to earn a million dollars or make Reddit memes. I simply would ask for attribution as a matter of basic human decency. Note that this open policy only applies to this blog and not my other endeavours.
