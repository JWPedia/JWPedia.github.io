Hi, I am Jeewoong Chang, an undergraduate computer science major studying in the University of Rochester. Welcome to my personal blog!

This website's name, JWPedia, stands for JeeWoong chang's Personal encyclopEDIA. I've been using it as my email address for a long time, with the idea that people should go to an encyclopedia to hear from the world, and contact me at this address to hear from me. Now, you can visit my website to read about my thoughts.

(Unfortunately, jwpedia.com has an uncanny resemblance with some Jehovah's Witness websites. I would like to make it clear that I am not a Jehovah's Witness, nor am I affiliated with them in any way. It's just a sick coincidence.)

I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, and simple, intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to leverage technology in an intentional manner to facilitate a meaningful life.

You won't find me on social media. If you have anything to say, leave an email at [hello@jwpedia.com](mailto:hello@jwpedia.com).

Subscribe to future posts via [rss](https://jwpedia.com/feed.xml). If you don't have an rss reader, you can use an rss-to-email service like [blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/subscriptions/).

All posts are my original content, and they are all [open](/open). That means you can use them for any purpose. I won't chase after you if you use a post to earn a million dollars or make Reddit memes. I simply would ask for attribution as a matter of basic human decency.
