Hi, I am Jeewoong Chang, an undergraduate computer science major studying in the University of Rochester. Welcome to my personal blog!

This website's name originates from a combination of my Korean name's initial (JeeWoong) and suffix "-pedia" from the word encyclopedia. I've been using it as my email address for a long time, with the idea that people should go to an encyclopedia to find out about the world, and contact me at "jwpedia" to hear from me. Now, you can visit my website to read about my thoughts.

I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, and simple, intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to leverage technology in an intentional manner to facilitate a meaningful life.

All posts are my original content. These articles are all [open](/open). You can use them for any use with attribution. (CC-BY)

You won't find me on social media. If you have anything to say, leave an email [here.](mailto:hello@jwpedia.com)
