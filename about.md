Hi, I am Jeewoong "Skaliq" Chang, an undergraduate computer science major in the University of Rochester.

I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, and simple, intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to leverage technology in an intentional manner to facilitate a meaningful life.
