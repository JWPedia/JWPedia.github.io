Hi, I am Jeewoong Chang, an undergraduate computer science major studying in the University of Rochester. Welcome to my personal blog!

This website's name originates from a combination of my initial (**j** ee **w** oong Chang) and the suffix "-pedia" from "encyclopedia" as used in wikipedia. I've been using it as my email address for a long time, with the idea that people should go to an encyclopedia to find out about the world, and contact me at "jwpedia" to hear from me. 

I write about a wide range of interests spanning technology, biological sciences, media criticism, and simple, intentional living. I am particularly interested in how to leverage technology in an intentional manner to facilitate a meaningful life.

All posts are my original content. These articles are all [open](/open). You can use them for any use with attribution. (CC-BY)

You won't find me on social media. If you have anything to say, leave an email [here.](mailto:hello@jwpedia.com)
