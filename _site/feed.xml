Despite having tried every task manager under the sun, I’ve found a text file to be the most reliable and efficient. It was quite validating to learn that a computer science professor thinks the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general workflow is the same as Jeff Huang’s:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep track of tasks on a calendar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plan the day in a text file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep a record as tasks are completed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some differences optimize my system for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;monthly-calendar&quot;&gt;Monthly Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of using an external calendar, I create a text-based calendar in a word document. This is to take advantage of a text-based system while having a visual overview of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I use LibreOffice, a simple table can be created in Microsoft Word, OneNote, Google Docs, or any other program of your choice. (if you’re adventurous, you can even hard code a table in HTML or TeX.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I keep track of my tasks and important appointments on the said calendar. Here’s the catch, which makes my system truly flexible and extensible: I created a custom markup system. Here’s the syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One line is one task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a task./After a slash is a subtask./This is a second subtask.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;{Curly brackets mean this is a schedule. I also write down the time: 12 PM}&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;Pointy brackets mean this is an errand. I’ll do it in my spare time in between larger tasks.&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Square brackets mean that I’ve delegated this task or I’m waiting on someone else’s input.]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Completed tasks are crossed out.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canceled tasks are crossed out and italicized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important tasks are bolded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Overdue tasks are highlighted.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These syntaxes are easy to apply and universal, making it portable. Furthermore, these markups can be used in conjunction with each other in any combination. A typical day’s worth of tasks may end up looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;{Chinese 12:30 PM}&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note: Remember to email prof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;{Discrete math 2 PM}&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;{Major advisor meeting}&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Math HW/Webwork/&lt;/del&gt;&lt;mark&gt;Written HW&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pick up mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an example calendar of this month:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Media/sample-calendar.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sample Calendar Spread&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;daily-planner&quot;&gt;Daily Planner&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other part of my system is a daily markdown file, named simply as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;yyyy-mm-dd.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the part where my method converges with Jeff Huang’s. Every evening, I plan the next day using the same syntax. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Morning routine 10 AM - 12 AM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&amp;lt;Anki&amp;gt; 12PM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;{CHI152 12:30 PM}&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;{MTH150 2PM}&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lunch break&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homework 4 PM - 6 PM
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;MTH reading&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;CHI essay writing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Admin 1 hr&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chill
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Home workout&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Media consumption&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evening routine &amp;amp; sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This text document becomes my journal as the day progresses. I often even sit down at the end of the day to write a more traditional journal entry at the bottom of the document. So, at the end of the day, the markdown file may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Morning routine 10AM - 12AM&lt;/del&gt; troubleshoot zoom connectivity issue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;&amp;lt;Anki&amp;gt; 12PM&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;{CHI152 12:30 PM}&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;{MTH150 2PM}&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Lunch break&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;~Homework 4 PM - 6 PM~~
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;MTH reading&lt;/del&gt; finish up tmr&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;CHI essay writing&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Admin 1 hr&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Chill&lt;/del&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Home workout&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Media consumption&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Evening routine &amp;amp; sleep&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear diary: Today was a nice day. I’m writing a demo journal entry. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method has a few advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since I mostly work on a PC doing programming homework, I can manage my tasks from the same text editor that I code in. I also take lecture notes in markdown files, which means that I can live in one app during a workday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text documents are reliable. They won’t get acquired and end service like Wunderlist, nor will they break in the next OS update like Evernote often have on me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text documents are very flexible and my syntax takes full advantage of it. While flexible task management apps exist, they’re overly complex and take longer to tinker around with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text documents are light and are fast to sync across cloud storage on all devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text documents are simple and conducive for deep work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I still reap the benefits of having a visual roadmap of the monthly schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My to-do list becomes a journal, leaving a record of what happened in my days and how I felt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a closing remark, I will note that a formalized &lt;a href=&quot;http://todotxt.org/&quot;&gt;todo.txt&lt;/a&gt; syntax also exists if you’re intrigued in plain text productivity systems. While I’ve found it to be less intuitive than actually crossing out a task, some people seem to swear by it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I recently came across Jeff Huang’s .txt productivity system via Cal Newport’s blog post.

&lt;p&gt;Even so, I stuck around, only as I loved the operating system. I even shared how I &lt;a href=&quot;/minimalist-gaming&quot;&gt;game on a MacBook.&lt;/a&gt; Shortly afterwards, frequent bugs on Bootcamp made maintaining an eGPU setup a chore and I gave up. That’s why I built a PC as my secondary entertainment hub. I used it to play video games and watch movies on a larger screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are about to change. COVID19 pandemic means that I no longer have to commute to campus. I’ll be stuck at the dorm to attend online classes, which means working on my desktop PC all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although getting used to Windows 10 took some time, with some tweaking, it became quite a comfortable workstation. This is my Windows 10 setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;debloating-windows-10&quot;&gt;Debloating Windows 10&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 comes with a lot of &lt;em&gt;crap.&lt;/em&gt; Not only is it spying on you, Cortana and native advertisements could also easily ruin the user experience. As such, the first thing I did was to uninstall most default applications and disable all advertisements and tracking. I also turned off tiles and notifications. Not having to deal with bloatware is the one thing that I miss about Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go a step further than me, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10&quot;&gt;debloat Windows 10.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;file-management&quot;&gt;File Management&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven’t found a cloud storage service that is as cost-effective and convenient for my needs than iCloud Drive. It is where my important files live, synced across all of my devices. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204283&quot;&gt;iCloud for Windows&lt;/a&gt;, I could sync iCloud Drive, Photos, and Mail to Windows. (Do bear in mind that I plan to gradually migrate to more secure alternatives like pCloud and Proton Mail.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to my school and personal files in iCloud Drive, research papers live in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/&quot;&gt;Zotero.&lt;/a&gt; Zotero is a free and open-source (FOSS) citation manager that works beautifully to streamline my essay-writing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t rely on commercial software for file management. My notes are markdown files written in a text editor, and I save my scanned paper documents as PDFs. I only use Microsoft Office - which I despise with a passion - only when I must. This way, I reduce dependency on a software developer and further future-proof my documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;email-rss-and-calendar&quot;&gt;Email, RSS, and Calendar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; is my desktop email, RSS, and calendar client of choice. Not only is it FOSS, but I also find its UI to make more sense than Mail.app or Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up emails with Thunderbird was easy, as the process is automated. I simply had to log into my existing email accounts, and voilà! No need to fiddle around with IMAP or POP3 settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose Thunderbird as my email client so that I can also receive RSS feeds on the same page, my preferred method of subscribing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/111680/how-to-find-channel-rss-feed-on-youtube&quot;&gt;Youtube channels&lt;/a&gt; and news. (RSS is also the only way to subscribe to this blog.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thunderbird also comes bundled with a handy Calendar extension. However, thanks to Apple’s ass-backward policies, syncing iCloud calendar to Thunderbird was a chore. &lt;a href=&quot;https://frightanic.com/apple-mac/thunderbird-icloud-calendar-sync/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is the best step-by-step guide on how to use iCloud Calendar with Thunderbird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;web-browser&quot;&gt;Web Browser&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; is my web browser of choice. I like it because it is cross-platform and it respects my privacy. Only a few tweaks in settings are needed to completely disable all tracking. It also has a healthy Add-on ecosystem. Here are some of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblocker-ultimate/?src=search&quot;&gt;Adblocker Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; for a quiet web.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/?src=search&quot;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt; is a FOSS cross-platform password manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkmode/&quot;&gt;Dark Mode&lt;/a&gt; means a darker web is only a button away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/&quot;&gt;DF Youtube (Distraction Free)&lt;/a&gt; hides the addicting parts of Youtube.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors&quot;&gt;Zotero Connector&lt;/a&gt; streamlines the process of saving web pages or PDFs to Zotero.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/&quot;&gt;SingleFile&lt;/a&gt; makes archiving a webpage into a single HTML file as easy as clicking a button. This extension is my replacement for Evernote Web Clipper.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;productivity&quot;&gt;Productivity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entire website is written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite text editor. It has a plethora of useful plugins, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/atom-latex&quot;&gt;atom-latex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/file-icons&quot;&gt;file-icons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/&quot;&gt;markdown-preview-enhanced&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/open-terminal-here&quot;&gt;open-terminal-here.&lt;/a&gt; Since I don’t yet write programs that are large enough to warrant using IDEs, all code is written in Atom and executed in the terminal. Atom’s only pitfall is that it’s written in Electron, which causes high power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the terminal, I hate working with the Windows command prompt. My saving grace was installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Available for free on the Microsoft app store, it opens up all sorts of bash command line trickery to a Windows PC. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; gem that powers this website, for instance, runs on Ubuntu. I love having access to both the conveniences of using Windows and the power of a bash shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My SAT and Chinese scores owe a lot to Anki. &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&quot;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; is a FOSS spaced-repetition flashcard app that smartly shows you difficult cards more often than easy cards. It works seriously well - anyone who has to memorize facts should be using Anki. Even though other flashcard apps like Quizlet exist, Anki still excels in three aspects: customizability, free cost, and the spaced repetition algorithm. While it does have a high barrier to entry, it’s worth watching some Youtube tutorials to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;other-tools&quot;&gt;Other Tools&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://krita.org/en/&quot;&gt;Krita&lt;/a&gt; is a perfectly functional FOSS digital painting application. For amateurs like me, Krita’s feature set is more than enough without having to cough off the cost of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astrill.com/&quot;&gt;Astrill VPN&lt;/a&gt; ensures privacy online. It also helps me access the global web in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foldingathome.org/&quot;&gt;FAHClient (Folding@Home)&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to contribute to disease research - such as COVID19 - by donating some computing power for protein folding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html&quot;&gt;SumatraPDF&lt;/a&gt; is the best lightweight PDF and eBook reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tomighty.github.io/&quot;&gt;Tomighty&lt;/a&gt; is a free and no-bullshit Pomodoro timer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://transmissionbt.com/&quot;&gt;Transmission&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite BitTorrent client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/apps/battle.net/desktop&quot;&gt;Battle.net,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/about/&quot;&gt;Steam,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/&quot;&gt;Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; are popular video game launchers that I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;general-takeaways&quot;&gt;General Takeaways&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although most people default to (often pirating) popular, commercial software, there is plenty of free and open-source software that can do the same job better. You only have to do some research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the FOSS community, even a travesty of an operating system (note: this is my personal, subjective opinion) such as Windows 10 can become a very productive environment. Much of this is achieved by using open standards for working whenever possible. For instance, I write blog posts in plain text files, archive paper documents as PDFs and web pages as HTML files, and use RSS for news feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though a lot of FOSS may be intimidating for casual consumers, it is surprisingly easy to get used to. Furthermore, since many are cross-platform, I can now work more or less in the same way in any desktop OS, whether that be Windows, macOS, or Linux.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s no secret that I love macOS.

Not having to deal with bloatware is the one thing that I miss about Linux. If you want to go a step further than me, check out debloat Windows 10. File Management I still haven’t found a cloud storage service that is as cost-effective and convenient for my needs than iCloud Drive. It is where my important files live, synced across all of my devices. With iCloud for Windows, I could sync iCloud Drive, Photos, and Mail to Windows. (Do bear in mind that I plan to gradually migrate to more secure alternatives like pCloud and Proton Mail.) In addition to my school and personal files in iCloud Drive, research papers live in Zotero. Zotero is a free and open-source (FOSS) citation manager that works beautifully to streamline my essay-writing process. I don’t rely on commercial software for file management. My notes are markdown files written in a text editor, and I save my scanned paper documents as PDFs. I only use Microsoft Office - which I despise with a passion - only when I must. This way, I reduce dependency on a software developer and further future-proof my documents. Email, RSS, and Calendar Thunderbird is my desktop email, RSS, and calendar client of choice. Not only is it FOSS, but I also find its UI to make more sense than Mail.app or Outlook. Setting up emails with Thunderbird was easy, as the process is automated. I simply had to log into my existing email accounts, and voilà! No need to fiddle around with IMAP or POP3 settings. I chose Thunderbird as my email client so that I can also receive RSS feeds on the same page, my preferred method of subscribing to Youtube channels and news. (RSS is also the only way to subscribe to this blog.) Thunderbird also comes bundled with a handy Calendar extension. However, thanks to Apple’s ass-backward policies, syncing iCloud calendar to Thunderbird was a chore. Here is the best step-by-step guide on how to use iCloud Calendar with Thunderbird. Web Browser Firefox is my web browser of choice. I like it because it is cross-platform and it respects my privacy. Only a few tweaks in settings are needed to completely disable all tracking. It also has a healthy Add-on ecosystem. Here are some of my favorites: Adblocker Ultimate for a quiet web. Bitwarden is a FOSS cross-platform password manager. Dark Mode means a darker web is only a button away. DF Youtube (Distraction Free) hides the addicting parts of Youtube. Zotero Connector streamlines the process of saving web pages or PDFs to Zotero. SingleFile makes archiving a webpage into a single HTML file as easy as clicking a button. This extension is my replacement for Evernote Web Clipper. Productivity This entire website is written in Atom, my favorite text editor. It has a plethora of useful plugins, such as atom-latex, file-icons, markdown-preview-enhanced, and open-terminal-here. Since I don’t yet write programs that are large enough to warrant using IDEs, all code is written in Atom and executed in the terminal. Atom’s only pitfall is that it’s written in Electron, which causes high power consumption. Speaking of the terminal, I hate working with the Windows command prompt. My saving grace was installing the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Available for free on the Microsoft app store, it opens up all sorts of bash command line trickery to a Windows PC. The Jekyll gem that powers this website, for instance, runs on Ubuntu. I love having access to both the conveniences of using Windows and the power of a bash shell. My SAT and Chinese scores owe a lot to Anki. Anki is a FOSS spaced-repetition flashcard app that smartly shows you difficult cards more often than easy cards. It works seriously well - anyone who has to memorize facts should be using Anki. Even though other flashcard apps like Quizlet exist, Anki still excels in three aspects: customizability, free cost, and the spaced repetition algorithm. While it does have a high barrier to entry, it’s worth watching some Youtube tutorials to get going. Other Tools Krita is a perfectly functional FOSS digital painting application. For amateurs like me, Krita’s feature set is more than enough without having to cough off the cost of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Astrill VPN ensures privacy online. It also helps me access the global web in China. FAHClient (Folding@Home) is an easy way to contribute to disease research - such as COVID19 - by donating some computing power for protein folding. SumatraPDF is the best lightweight PDF and eBook reader. Tomighty is a free and no-bullshit Pomodoro timer. Transmission is my favorite BitTorrent client. Battle.net, Steam, and Epic Games Store are popular video game launchers that I use. General Takeaways Although most people default to (often pirating) popular, commercial software, there is plenty of free and open-source software that can do the same job better. You only have to do some research. Thanks to the FOSS community, even a travesty of an operating system (note: this is my personal, subjective opinion) such as Windows 10 can become a very productive environment. Much of this is achieved by using open standards for working whenever possible. For instance, I write blog posts in plain text files, archive paper documents as PDFs and web pages as HTML files, and use RSS for news feeds. Even though a lot of FOSS may be intimidating for casual consumers, it is surprisingly easy to get used to. Furthermore, since many are cross-platform, I can now work more or less in the same way in any desktop OS, whether that be Windows, macOS, or Linux.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taming the PC</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/pc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taming the PC" /><published>2020-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-03-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/pc</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/pc/">&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that &lt;a href=&quot;/minimalist-gaming&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/catalina&quot;&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/catalina&quot;&gt;macOS.&lt;/a&gt; However, I’ve been burned enough by Apple’s reluctance to timely address some of their biggest hardware flaws: exorbitantly high prices, bad graphics, shoddy thermals, and the infamous butterfly keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, I could read well-researched books and articles, and participate in mutually respectful real-world conversations. Waging a poorly organized, scantly fact-checked culture war on the internet is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not just social media. Why did I find it satisfying to curate my public Goodreads profile? I’m no book reviewer, so I don’t need to publicize it. I don’t need an over-engineered remote database to keep track of books. I can simply create a list myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to question this urge for publicity and to minimize my online presence as much as possible. Currently, only this blog remains. It’s minimal - no ads, no follow buttons, no comment boxes. It’s also rarely visited, partly as a direct consequence of my non-existent social media promotion. I’m okay with that. I love this kind of a quiet internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not opposed to all online forums and profile curation services. Some can be useful for specific purposes. For instance, an amateur birdwatcher may make great use out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebird.org/home&quot;&gt;eBird&lt;/a&gt;, an artist may want to have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artstation.com/contests&quot;&gt;ArtStation&lt;/a&gt; profile, or a developer may use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, why do we default to these online services that are often over-engineered for most use cases? Do we ever sit down to question whether these tools are the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; way to support our crafts and hobbies? Or simply the convenient default? I suspect that often it is the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I feel like there is an instinctual and incessant urge to publicize everything on the internet ingrained onto us.

&lt;p&gt;I recently revisited the book &lt;a href=&quot;/quality-feb-2019&quot;&gt;Digital Minimalism&lt;/a&gt;. This time, however, I borrowed a physical copy through my university’s interlibrary loan program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of moving away from my &lt;a href=&quot;/reading-habit&quot;&gt;exclusively digital&lt;/a&gt; reading habit is to rediscover some of the lost values of analog: analog reading, analog writing, and analog existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an experiment, I am going to fully commit to a month-long digital detox as suggested in Digital Minimalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the only digital technologies that I am allowed to use are the bare essentials:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use email and browse the web for schoolwork and other necessary purposes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use a messaging application &lt;em&gt;on a computer&lt;/em&gt; to have video calls with my family back at home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can send text messages and make phone calls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog replacement is not available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can use a computer for programming and related tasks, such as occasionally posting to this blog, experimenting with the bash shell, or using XCode to practice Swift development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I am not allowed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Browse the internet for entertainment, especially Reddit and Youtube.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a computer for schoolwork when a suitable analog alternative exists.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unnecessarily check my phone or email.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Play video games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consume digital media in a non-social setting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subscribe to any type of feed, such as email newsletters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stick to these rules, I made some lifestyle changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I got a paper journal (on which this very post is being written).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed every single non-default app from my phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I removed Windows installation from my desktop computer and installed Pop! OS, an Ubuntu variant, instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I learned the basics of the bash shell so that I can get things done on the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I borrowed three paper books to read in my leisure time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started wearing an automatic watch instead of using my phone to check my time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I started turning off my phone during the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the time I have now due to purging digital entertainment, I will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting work done.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reading books.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relaxing more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meditating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Socializing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going on walks.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what my Macbook’s desktop looks like. It is free from all possible sources of distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be difficult to focus if your workspace was littered with loose documents, empty coca-cola cans, stationeries, and doodles. The same principle applies to our digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a tech-junkie and a computer science student, my laptop is the space that I spend most of my time in. So, I made it into the most focused setup possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means that I will follow these rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce all visual clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eliminate all potential interruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If a task that a digital tool performs is not highly valuable, eliminate said tool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the simplest technology that accomplishes a valuable task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since advertisements are the enemy of minimalism, use the more private option when two options are otherwise comparable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;operating-system&quot;&gt;Operating System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;macOS is the simplest commercial desktop operating system. It has a minimalistic design language, and most things &lt;em&gt;just work&lt;/em&gt;. Not only that, as a Unix-like OS, working in the command line - the most focused environment possible - is a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do not want to police around which OS anyone uses. The rules above can be applied to every OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;os-level-settings&quot;&gt;OS-Level Settings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are all the OS-level settings I modify in System Preferences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;General
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Appearance: Dark&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Close windows when quitting an app&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automatically hide and save the menu bar&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Desktop &amp;amp; Screen Saver
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I chose an understated default wallpaper.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dock
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Size: minimum&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Magnification: off&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automatically hide and show the Dock&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mission Control
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use: off&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Have only 1 Space open by default&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screen Time: on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security &amp;amp; Privacy
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;FileVault disk encryption: on&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Firewall: on&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Privacy: limit ad tracking, do not share analytics&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notifications&quot;&gt;Notifications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notifications inherently violate rule 3: eliminate all potential interruptions. There is only one place where notifications are allowed: out of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In System Preferences &amp;gt; Notifications, I made some merciless changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing goes to the Notification Center&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No app may have a badge icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only Music and &lt;a href=&quot;tomighty.org&quot;&gt;Tomighty&lt;/a&gt; may send out a banner-style notification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just in case I missed something, my MacBook is automatically put to Do Not Disturb mode from 9 to 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;file-management&quot;&gt;File Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My file management system has one goal - to be able to retrieve any needed file quickly from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so, clearing the Downloads and Desktop folder every evening has to become habitual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my files are stored in a single Documents folder that is synchronized to my devices via iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iCloud is the most secure cloud storage service out of the big-name options. Other alternatives, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, can and will read your data. For stronger security, you may want to use a zero-knowledge cloud service such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sync.com/&quot;&gt;Sync.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, iCloud is the sweet spot between convenience and security. With two-factor authentication enabled and a unique, frequently changed password, iCloud should be secure enough for most users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents folder is set as the default folder when Finder opens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Media/minimal-finder.png&quot; alt=&quot;Document folder organization&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what my Documents folder looks like. I use the tree view to quickly navigate through a deep folder structure with arrow keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Images folder is where all of my photos live. While Photos is convenient to use, I have had my iPhoto library corrupted enough times to know that a simple folder tree with image files won’t break in the next macOS update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mastermind folder holds some files for organizing my time. I will defer explaining my rich text productivity system to a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Notable folder holds markdown notes. Markdown syntax is easy to learn, platform-independent, and unlikely to break so as long as plain text files exist. I edit markdown files in &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced&quot;&gt;markdown-preview-enhanced&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-favorite-apps&quot;&gt;My Favorite Apps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will discuss some of these Apps and how I set them up in future posts. For now, remember that reducing visual clutter is rule 1 and that using the simplest technology that gets the job done is rule 5. I stick to Apple apps as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; is the most private commercial browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Media/mail.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail&lt;/strong&gt; is my email client of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Media/atom.png&quot; alt=&quot;Atom&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atom&lt;/strong&gt; is my favorite text editor. It is what I use to take notes and code simple projects. Coding programs purely in a text editor and command line also happens to be an exercise to improve programming skills. I also use &lt;strong&gt;IntelliJ IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Xcode&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ImageOptim&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Github CLI&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/Media/tomighty.png&quot; alt=&quot;Tomighty&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tomighty&lt;/strong&gt; is a free and simple pomodoro timer app with no bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; is the simplest, functional calendar app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IINA&lt;/strong&gt; is my video player of choice. It is like VLC with a mac-native feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Music for Students&lt;/strong&gt; is my favorite music streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iBooks&lt;/strong&gt; is my favorite way to read books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I try to stay away from it, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/strong&gt; is also installed due to necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A minimal Mac setup takes little initial effort and can lead to higher productivity and clarity. I highly recommend any modern knowledge worker to follow some of the steps I described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In upcoming posts, I will discuss minimal iPhone and iPad setup, private web browsing, and rich text productivity system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This is what my Macbook’s desktop looks like. It is free from all possible sources of distractions. It would be difficult to focus if your workspace was littered with loose documents, empty coca-cola cans, stationeries, and doodles. The same principle applies to our digital environment. As a tech-junkie and a computer science student, my laptop is the space that I spend most of my time in. So, I made it into the most focused setup possible. It means that I will follow these rules: Reduce all visual clutter. Eliminate all potential interruptions. If a task that a digital tool performs is not highly valuable, eliminate said tool. Use the simplest technology that accomplishes a valuable task. Since advertisements are the enemy of minimalism, use the more private option when two options are otherwise comparable. Operating System macOS is the simplest commercial desktop operating system. It has a minimalistic design language, and most things just work. Not only that, as a Unix-like OS, working in the command line - the most focused environment possible - is a breeze. That being said, I do not want to police around which OS anyone uses. The rules above can be applied to every OS. OS-Level Settings Here are all the OS-level settings I modify in System Preferences: General Appearance: Dark Close windows when quitting an app Automatically hide and save the menu bar Desktop &amp;amp; Screen Saver I chose an understated default wallpaper. Dock Size: minimum Magnification: off Automatically hide and show the Dock Mission Control Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use: off Have only 1 Space open by default Screen Time: on Security &amp;amp; Privacy FileVault disk encryption: on Firewall: on Privacy: limit ad tracking, do not share analytics Notifications Notifications inherently violate rule 3: eliminate all potential interruptions. There is only one place where notifications are allowed: out of my life. In System Preferences &amp;gt; Notifications, I made some merciless changes. Nothing goes to the Notification Center No app may have a badge icon Only Music and Tomighty may send out a banner-style notification Just in case I missed something, my MacBook is automatically put to Do Not Disturb mode from 9 to 6. File Management My file management system has one goal - to be able to retrieve any needed file quickly from anywhere. To do so, clearing the Downloads and Desktop folder every evening has to become habitual. All of my files are stored in a single Documents folder that is synchronized to my devices via iCloud. iCloud is the most secure cloud storage service out of the big-name options. Other alternatives, such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, can and will read your data. For stronger security, you may want to use a zero-knowledge cloud service such as Sync.com. Personally, iCloud is the sweet spot between convenience and security. With two-factor authentication enabled and a unique, frequently changed password, iCloud should be secure enough for most users. Documents folder is set as the default folder when Finder opens. This is what my Documents folder looks like. I use the tree view to quickly navigate through a deep folder structure with arrow keys. The Images folder is where all of my photos live. While Photos is convenient to use, I have had my iPhoto library corrupted enough times to know that a simple folder tree with image files won’t break in the next macOS update. The Mastermind folder holds some files for organizing my time. I will defer explaining my rich text productivity system to a later post. The Notable folder holds markdown notes. Markdown syntax is easy to learn, platform-independent, and unlikely to break so as long as plain text files exist. I edit markdown files in Atom with markdown-preview-enhanced package. My Favorite Apps I will discuss some of these Apps and how I set them up in future posts. For now, remember that reducing visual clutter is rule 1 and that using the simplest technology that gets the job done is rule 5. I stick to Apple apps as much as possible.

Atom is my favorite text editor. It is what I use to take notes and code simple projects.
